Advanced Menu and Advanced Dialog are designed to add more flexibility with drawing text and text boxes to the overlay but maintaining the ease of use. The plugin utilizes the ability to copy background tiles to the window layer (overlay) to create the *illusion* of placing dialog and text boxes anywhere on screen. This is normally not possible in GB Studio by default.

Both plugins also add control of the size and position of text boxes independent of text in order to give the user more design options. Each also adds the ability to display sprites, invert the color of variable width text, or display text without a border

The plugins' main function is to copy the current cameraâ€™s view of the background onto the overlay, displaying it over the real background. The overlay houses all text tiles and so text can exist on any part by default. 

**Bugs/Issues**

Currently the use of avatars inverts text color. If you use avatars just be aware or use sprites instead.

More detailed documentation will be released soon.
